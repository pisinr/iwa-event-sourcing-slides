# Event Sourcing
## and some other stuffs.

---

# Event Sourcing
## + Domain-Driven Design

---

# What is Event Sourcing
## Source of truth is events.

Events are all records that matters.


---

# Event Sourcing is ancient tech.

---

## Accounting and Bank

| Action | Amount |
|----|----|
| AccountCreated | 0 |
| AmountDeposited | 150 |
| AmountDeposited | 70 |
| AmountWithdrawn | 200 |
| .... | .... |

Your account balance is the result of all your transaction.

---

## Version Control System

```
$ git log
....
....

```

Your current source code is the result of addition/deletions in all commits.

---

## Database

Write-ahead Log is just record of changes.

---

# Example: Order System.

---

## Traditional database.

```
  CREATE TABLE OrderHeader (..);
  CREATE TABLE OrderLineItem (..);
```

<div style={{height: 50}}></div>

| id  |  CustomerName | Address | Requested |
|-----|---------------|---------|----------|
| 1234  |  John Smith | blah ... | false |

<div style={{height: 50}}></div>

| id  |  OrderId | Product |  Quantity | Amount |
|-----|---------------|---------|----|----|
| 111  |  1234 | Burger | 1 | 15 |
| 112  |  1234 | Water | 3 | 30 |

---

## Event Store.

### StreamName: "Order-1234"

| EventNumber | EventType | PayLoad |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | OrderCreated | { id: 1234 } |
| 2 | OrderShippingUpdated | { CustomerName: 'John Smith', Address: '...'} |
| 3 | OrderItemAdded | { Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 1, Amount: 15 }
| 4 | OrderItemAdded | { Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 3, Amount: 30 }

---

## Let's Remove an Item and send the order request.

---

## Traditional database.

```
  UPDATE OrderLineItem SET Amount = Amount-1 WHERE ...;
  UPDATE OrderHeader SET Requested = true WHERE ...;
```

<div style={{height: 50}}></div>

| id  |  CustomerName | Address | Requested |
|-----|---------------|---------|----------|
| 1234  |  John Smith | blah ... | true |

<div style={{height: 50}}></div>

| id  |  OrderId | Product |  Quantity | Amount |
|-----|---------------|---------|----|----|
| 111  |  1234 | Burger | 1 | 15 |
| 112  |  1234 | Water | 2 | 20 |

---

## Event Store.

### StreamName: "Order-1234"

| EventNumber | EventType | PayLoad |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | OrderCreated | { id: 1234 } |
| 2 | OrderShippingUpdated | { CustomerName: 'John Smith', Address: '...'} |
| 3 | OrderItemAdded | { Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 1, Amount: 15 }
| 4 | OrderItemAdded | { Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 3, Amount: 30 }
| 5 | OrderItemRemoved | { Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 1, Amount: 10 }
| 6 | OrderRequested | { }

---

## 1. Only Events are persisted, not state.
## 2. Past Events are immutable.

---

## How to write the controller

`DoRemoveItem(id: 1234,Product: 'Water')`

1. Load all events from beginning of time [0].
2. Sequentially apply each event.
3. Create resulting Events (`OrderItemRemoved`)
4. Performed the action by Persisting Events.
5. (Optionally) Apply the created events. Return latest state.

---

### In code

```
def remove_item()
  order = Order.load("Order-#{params[:id]}")
  saveToStream("Order-#{params[:id]}",
    'OrderItemRemoved',
    {
      Product: product,
      Quantity: quantity,
      Amount: amount,
    }
  )
end

```

---

## Some Code

```
class Order < Aggregate
  def load(streamName)
    events = loadAllFromStream(streamName)
    @state = {}
    events.each do |ev|
      @state = apply(@state, ev)
    end
  end
end

```

---

```
class Order < Aggregate
  def apply(state, ev)
    switch ev.type
      case  'OrderCreated':
        return { requested: false, items: [] }
      case 'OrderItemAdded':
        item = state[:items][ev.payload[:Product]] ||= {
          Quantity: 0,
          Amount: 0
        }
        item[:Quantity] += ev.payload[:Quantity]
        item[:Amount] += ev.payload[:Amount]
      case 'OrderItemRemoved':
        ...
    end
  end
end

```

---

## Aggregate

* A Transactional Consitency Boundary of a business logic.
* Not an Entity, Graph of Entities.
* An Aggregate is contained in one Event Stream.

---

## Rebuilding State.

```
  [1] OrderCreated(id: 1234)

  Order = {
    id: 1234,
    CustomerName: null,
    Address: null,
    Items: [],
    Total: 0,
  }

```

---

## Rebuilding State.

```
  [2] OrderShippingUpdated(
    CustomerName: 'John Smith',
    Address: 'blah...'
  )


  Order = {
    id: 1234,
    CustomerName: 'John Smith',
    Address: 'blah...',
    Items: [],
    Total: 0,
  }

```

---

## Rebuilding State.

```
  [3] OrderItemAdded(Product: 'Burger', Quantity: 1, Amount: 15)

  Order = {
    id: 1234,
    CustomerName: 'John Smith',
    Address: 'blah...',
    Items: [ {...} ],
    Total: 15,
  }

```

---

## Rebuilding State.

```
  [4] OrderItemAdded(Product: 'Water', Quantity: 3, Amount: 30)

  Order = {
    id: 1234,
    CustomerName: 'John Smith',
    Address: 'blah...',
    Items: [ {...}, {...} ],
    Total: 45,
  }

```

## Load Performance?

* Each aggregate is "usually" small.
* You can always create snapshot (Closing the book).

---

## Write Performance?

* Append is \*\*\*FAST\*\*\*.
* Transactional boundary per each stream.
* Optimistic Locking (Save with ExpectedVersion)

---

## Read Performance?

* Transform data to your flat denormalized form.
* Feed data to your search server
* CQRS


---

## Pro: 1. Audit and Logging.

* Audit First System.
* Log is now "free".
* State cannot be there without Log.

---

## Pro: 2. Great for analytics.

* You can not "go back in time" to collect data.
* You can "replay" the events.
* Temporal query (What was the state of the system at 2018/10/02?)

---

### Current state is derivative of events.
### You lose data as soon as you store state.

<div style={{height: 50}}></div>

### Can you decide what to lose?

---

## Pro 3: Fit for distributed system.

* DDD and Aggregate is good design for microservice.
* Event Stream is simple to use/integrate.

---

## Pro 4: Force business analysis.

* What the business does is more important than how to design data structure.

---

## Con: Force business analysis.

* You can't design the system until you know what happens.
* "Sprint 1: I want to cook something. Let's boil the eggs.".


---

## Handling Consitency.

* Aggregate: Boundary of transaction consistency.
* Read-only/Query system can live with eventual consistency.

---

## Handling GDPR.

* Create Separated Stream for Sensitive Data
* Delete those stream

---

... OR you can replay and filter out Identification data.

---

## Implementations.

* Event Store: https://eventstore.org/
* Rails Event Store: https://railseventstore.org/
* Roll your own.

# That's it.
